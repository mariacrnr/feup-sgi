## Project information
The game developed was Checkers.
In the start the player can start playing by pressing S. During the entirity of the game the points for each player and the time of the play are shown, as well as helpful messages to guide the user through the game.

From the interface menu, the user can choose between two different scenes:
- Park: previously implemented in the last two deliveries
- House: simple cabin house with only the table and a barrel

The pieces are animated when they are moving and piece selection is guided by colors (as well as the possible moves). The interface menu also allows the user to reset the game and undo the last move.

More details about the game can be found on the user manual.

## Issues/Problems
- Undo is not animated
- Camera animation not smooth when changing turns or selecting manually
- Tried to do game movie but couldn't due to the promises for the animations not being resolve, so we didn't include that.
- No spotlight following the piece moving.
